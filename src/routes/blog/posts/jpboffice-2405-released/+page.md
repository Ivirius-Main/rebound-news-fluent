Today, I have released jpb Office version 2405!

This release has been released for all three apps, UltraTextEdit (WPF), Sheets, and PowerNotepad.

The release itself is minor for all three apps, ahead of version 2406, which will feature a UI revamp across all three apps.

**TL;DR**: 2405 is not a huge release, but is definitely impactful for the apps' UX.

Download links of version 2405 for all the apps can be found at the bottom of the article.
## Changelog
The changelog of version 2405 for all three apps is as follows:
>What's New:
>
>- Make application DPI aware
>- Dependency updates

There has been no new features added to any of the apps, except the fact that the apps have been made DPI aware, allowing them to have a better, clearer user interface when used with different screen scaling options.
The dependency updates *do* update the Fluent 2 styles library that the apps use, however there are no changes to the actual components that the apps use from the library.
## Plans for version 2406
I don't really have any clear plans for version 2406 yet, but it will definitely use Fluent.Ribbon 11 across all the apps, bringing with it a new, modern Ribbon control that better fits the style and direction of the office suite.
