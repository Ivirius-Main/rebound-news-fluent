Hey everyone! Ivirius Text Editor 3.1 just RTMed today, and I thought it would be worthwile to explore its major features here, as part of its release announcement.


**TL;DR**: The update is a large one, not as massive as UTE UWP+ 24H2, which released to Insiders almost a month ago, but still very significant.
