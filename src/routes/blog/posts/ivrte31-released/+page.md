Hey everyone! Ivirius Text Editor 3.1 just RTMed today, and I thought it would be worthwile to explore its major features here, as part of its release announcement.


**TL;DR**: The update is a large one, not as massive as UTE UWP+ 24H2, which released to Insiders almost a month ago, but still very significant.

The major new features in Ivirius Text Editor 3.1 are as follows:

- Introducing VelocityIDs!!

- Add a redesigned Home Menu

- Add a Share function for sharing files

- Add a View tab

- Allow RichEditBox to be full-width via the Web Mode

## Features
Now let's begin exploring each of these features in detail.
### VelocityIDs
Velocity IDs have been around ever since the December 2023 patches for UTE UWP (TowPad-based) were released, which was before UTE UWP 24H1 RTMed and before UTE UWP Plus even began!

The idea of Velocity IDs themselves was inspired by the feature of the same name in Windows' Insider Previw builds, allowing certain hidden features and enhancements to be toggled.

As of the RTM build of IVR Free 3.1 (3.1.0.267), there are no Velocity IDs in the menu, but they will be added with future patches.

### Home Menu
The Home Menu was entirely redesigned from the ground up for Ivirius Text Editor 3.1.
It now features an actual NavigationView and many new pages to manage files and find out about the app, as well as change app settings.
